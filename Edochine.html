            Meet the Public Relations Officer of Youth Leadership & Advocacy, Mr. Mansaray Abu Edochie.

Abubakar Edochie Mansaray was born and raised in Kenema, the Eastern part of Sierra Leone. 
He primarily and secondarily schooled in Kenema where he attained his National Primary School Examination,
Basic Education Certificate Examination, and West Africa Senior School Certificate Examination certificates, respectively.
Later on, he had an opportunity to pursue online courses on Show Biz and Theater Arts from the University of Legon, in Ghana. 
Mr. Mansaray is one of the co-founders of the Sierra Leone Young Writers Union, formed in 2015, and he served as the president for two consecutive years.
His desire to serve the needy and less privileged came to fruition when he joined Sinava, Inc.,
(an international nonprofit organization that supports health and education) in 2017.
At Sinava, Inc., he was nurtured with the spirit of serving humanity, selflessly. Up until now, 
he unflaggingly surrenders his all to make sure that the mission and vision of the organization are achieved.
Mr. Mansaray is a volunteer at the KTV Network where he hosts an online talk show called the BIGtalk show. 
His unwavering love for television broadcasts landed him an opportunity to join the network that operates in Germany and the UK. 
Currently, he's the current public relations officer of Youth Leadership and Advocacy. 
This organization is a youth-led organization that's registered with the government of Sierra Leone through the National Youth Commission 
to complement the efforts of the government in youth development and gender empowerment to mitigate youth unemployment and gender-based violence in Sierra Leone.
