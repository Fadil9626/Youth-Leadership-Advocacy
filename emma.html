            Meet the Financial Secretary of Youth Leadership & Advocacy, Miss Nyanda Emma Hamilton.
            Ms. Nyanda Emma Hamilton is a third-year Law student at Fourah Bay College, University of Sierra Leone. 
            Emma is an active child and youth advocate who's concerned with issues affecting children and adolescents; not just in Sierra Leone, but across the world.
            Emma served as the President of the Children's Forum Network and Executive Member of Girl Child Network at the Annie Walsh Memorial School. 
            During her tenure as President of CFN at Annie Walsh Memorial School, she masterminded a powerful symposium with the theme "ZERO TO EARLY GIRL CHILD MARRIAGE" and this symposium was held to educate girls on the consequences of Child Marriage. 
            Miss Hamilton championed another campaign in 2019 "The Future is Female" where she visited different schools in Freetown to educate young adolescent girls about their rights, and how to take good care of their bodies and to be focused in school.
             In 2018, she worked as the school mentor for SMART WOMEN'S INITIATIVE, volunteer at Staco Insurance Company as a finance person, and in 2019 she volunteered with UN Women to be part of the youth survey team.
            Currently as it stands, she's occupying the financial secretary seat at the Youth Leadership and Advocacy. This organization is equally a youth led network that helps to minimize societal problems that are associated with gender-based violence, youth unemployability Ã©t cetera. And, without askance, Ms. Hamilton is undoubtedly working with the administrative set-up of the organization thus serving to promote the mission and vision of the organization.
