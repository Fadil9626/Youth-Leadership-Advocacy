            Meet the Executive Director for Youth Leadership & Advocacy Ambassador Mohamed Barrie.

He has been one of the key players that have supported so many female favored-policies, youth, and Children policies in Sierra Leone. He has been in advocacy since the early years of his secondary school. He was born and raised in Kenema, Sierra Leone.

At a very early age, he got fascinated by the prevailing conditions surrounding young children including himself. 

He said, "As one of the poorest countries, children and youth are exposed to numerous risks including teenage pregnancy, child marriage, lack of job opportunity, child Laboure, gender-based violence, poverty, poor health and homelessness that potentially hurt the child’s and youth’s cognitive, motor and social-emotional development." His above statement led to his strong campaign for children.

With relentless strides in children advocacy, he was elected as a National Vice President in the Children Forum Network (Children’s Parliament) in 2016 and later a National Interim President of the Children of Sierra Leone through the Children’s Forum Network. 

As a vice president, youth advocate, and diplomat, he implemented several advocacy programs with different advocacy organizations that empower individuals, children, and young people especially the girl child. 

Through partnering with established organizations like Ministry of Social Welfare Gender and Children’s Affairs, Ministry of Youth Affairs, Save the Children International, UNICEF, Plan International, Advocacy Movement Network, Kids Advocacy Network, Asmaa James Foundation, etc.; he was able to provide mentorship and capacity-building training for children and young people to realize their potentials, in Freetown and some part in the districts and condemn all violation against women and girls. 

With a passion for advocacy, over the years, he has always engaged radio and TV programs to discuss and raise awareness on issues affecting the welfare and protection of children and young people. He has been very firm against the violation of children’s rights or abuse. 

He is also passionate about development, during the just concluded general elections (2018) in my country where he championed “the children should not involve in politics campaign” with the National Commission for Children, other civil societies organizations, and also the mobilization of young people to raise awareness on the theme “Election is not a war” targeting students and communities. 

As a highly motivated and determined person that is contributing immensely to the development of young people in Sierra Leone, his goal has always been to create a change in his life and the lives of others especially young and vulnerable people who lack the platform to express their concerns.

He is also a configured model at United Nations diplomat, who has represented Sierra Leone in other parts of the continent and also stimulate the model United Nations procedures or systems accordingly. 

Currently, He is the elected male representative (designate) at the National Commission for children's board, former Publicity Secretary for Sierra Leone International Model United Nations (SIMUN). A volunteer at Asmaa James Foundation and Girls Plus and the Executive Director of Youth Leadership and Advocacy. 

He has represented children and young people in national and international policy forum and has won numerous awards and certificates for his relentless service to the children and young people of Sierra Leone which earned him a spot in the “twenty young influential persons in Sierra Leone” by Global Youth Innovation Network 2018 and recently he was nominated by the Advance Media in Ghana Accra, as the "Youth Advocate in Africa 2020"

Thank you.
