              <b>YOUTH LEADERSHIP AND ADVOCACY HOLDS A YOUTH SEMINAR AND OFFICIALLY LAUNCHES THE ORGANIZATION.</b> <br>
             
               On the 24th day of March 2021, Youth Leadership and Advocacy held a massive seminar and the organization was officially launched at the Africell American Corner, in Freetown. <br>
               
               Youth Leadership and Advocacy is an organization that was formed by resourceful young people from across the country. This organization has successfully registered with the government of Sierra Leone through the national youth commission. <br>
               
               On the aforementioned date, the organization decided to hold a seminar on youth-related issues that will not only capacitate the audience with different professional development; but also, give them overall success in the field of youth participation and empowerment. <br>
               
               The seminar attached to the official launch of YLA was as a result of building an unbendable relationship with other like-minded young people that have carved out niches for themselves in the world of advocacy and also to better understand the dynamics of youth-related advocacy and to get this done, experts were invited to share with us their success stories, challenges and possible ways of overcoming the inescapable hurdles in the field of advocacy. <br>
               
               The organization was officially launched as a youth-serving agency by the Deputy Minister of Youth Affairs Hon. Lusine Kallon. Asmaa James Kamara CEO of Girls+ made a statement that inspired members of YLA on the challenges involving running an organization/institution. And Mr. Charles Vandi the Director of Gender from the Ministry of Gender and Children's Affairs also spoke on the necessity of women/girls inclusion in building institution and communities, also he spoke on policies that pave the path for the empowerment of women and youth across the world. <br>
               
               The seminar was facilitated by experienced individuals, Coach Robert Burale from Kenya spoke on the Art of Public Speaking, Hawa Samai spoke on Advocacy, Dr. Fatu Taqi spoke on Career Development, Rev. William spoke on Banking and Chernor Bah of Purposeful spoke on Leadership. <br>
