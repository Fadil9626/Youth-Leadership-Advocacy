        <h1>  Online Introduction of Youth Leadership and Advocacy  (YLA)</h1>
       
        <p>
    
    Hello everyone! I’m Amb Mohamed Harass Barrie, a Youth and Child Advocate with six years of experience in advocacy. I’m passionate about the well-being of children and young people and the protection and promotion of human rights. 
    
    I have been working with different advocacy organizations to promote the rights of children and young people, to raise awareness on issues affecting the fundamental development of children and young people, and to advocate for policy formulation and reformation - policies that will foster the development of everyone (women, children, youth, and physically-challenged) across the continent. 
    
    With lots of strides in the field of advocacy and with my passion to contribute to the development of Sierra Leone, it's my singular honor to inform you all through this medium that I have founded a youth-serving organization known as <strong> YOUTH LEADERSHIP AND ADVOCACY (YLA)</strong>.
    
    Youth Leadership and Advocacy (YLA) is a youth-led organization registered with the government of Sierra Leone through the National Youth Commission to complement the efforts of the government in youth development and gender empowerment and to mitigate the high rate of youth unemployment and gender-based violence in Sierra Leone. 
    
     YLA comprises Twelve University students across the country, six males and six females, with vast experience in advocacy and youth development issues. 
    
    As a youth organization, we organize youth empowerment programs/conferences, capacity building training/seminars for Individuals and youth groups, and advocate for gender empowerment, inclusion & participation.
    
    Our mission is to create a platform where young people maximize their fullest potentials. Our vision is to see a reformed society that allows youths to enhance their enormous potentials in nation-building. Our core Principles and Values are; Equality and Equity, Independence, Professionalism, Accountability and Transparency, and Integrity. <br> <br>
    
    Thank you! <br> <br>
    
    Ambassador Mohamed Barrie, <br>
    Executive Director, <br>
    Youth Leadership & Advocacy <br>
    22nd January 2021.
